# typescrambler

My Android homework project for the 2019 **Mobile- and Web-based Software** course at **BME VIK**.

Typescrambler is a simple Android typing game. On each level, a random English word is picked, and
its letters are scattered over a grid, forming a randomized "keyboard". Your goal is to type in the
word before the timer runs out to reach the next level. The levels increase in difficulty as the
generated words get longer and the timing becomes more strict. The Highscores screen displays a
list of all your previous attempts.
